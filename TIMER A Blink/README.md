Now instead of using a loop, we can untilize timer modules to dictate the speed the LED toggles. For the G2 board I set P1.0 (red LED) and P1.6 (green LED) as an output and set their intial state as off. I then set up both TA0CCR0 which will control the speed the LEDs blinks. Setting them to different rates to see a difference in speed. After I then enabled the timer for A0 (green LED) and A1 (red LED). Then set the ACLK to count up for both. Lastly set both vectors to match each LED in order toggle the LEDs on/off.

For the F5529 board I set P1.0 (red LED) and P4.7 (green LED) as an output and set their intial state as off. I then set up both TA0CCR0 which will control the speed the LEDs blinks. Setting them to different rates to see a difference in speed. After I then enabled the timer for A0 (green LED) and A1 (red LED). Then set the ACLK to count up for both. Lastly set both vectors to match each LED in order toggle the LEDs on/off.
