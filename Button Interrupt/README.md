An interrupt is used in this lab to keep the LED at the current state when a button is pressed. Therefore the G2 board I set P1.0 as an output which will be the LED. Then enabled a pull up resistor at P1.3. Then set the value as 1 at P1.3 in order to use the switch. Now also at P1.3 I set the interrupt and followed by next line code which clears the interrupt when the button is pressed again. Finally inside the interrupt void, you set the toggle for the LED at P1.0 and the interrupt at the button P1.3.

The FR2311 board didnt vary too much from the G2 board except different ports. I set P1.0 as an output which will be the LED. Then enabled a pull up resistor at P1.1. Then set the value as 1 at P1.1 in order to use the switch. Now also at P1.1 I set the interrupt and followed by next line code which clears the interrupt when the button is pressed again. Finally inside the interrupt void, you set the toggle for the LED at P1.0 and the interrupt at the button P1.1.
